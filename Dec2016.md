**12/8/26**

Last 2 days at hospital being with Bob (mostly) and Zo as they emerged from their surgeries and prepared for discharge. Zo to Jennifer's for a month or so; Bob to convalescent home for convalescence for 6 weeks then PT for 6 weeks.  Will return home when Zo can care for him.

Today to finish loose threads with above:

- visit Bob and check with day staff re: understanding of Bob's needs and limitations.
- Call for sister and friends to update them.

Work today:


- fix form issue on SOSLsd.org
- review consolidate to do lists.

Tired today. There. My 100 words.  I like this habit - except when not rested.  Think I'll eat then nap.

Using new sleep app. Goal: get my bedtime and wake up time routine and regulated so I wake up rested and during light sleep. Up at 5:35 AM on my own and feeling alert.  

I think I need to set it for 7.5 or 8 hours but this is good enough.  Up before Barney could wake us.  He hoped on to me a few seconds after I woke up though.

Today:
 
  **HOME:**

1. Mike to pick up his things (mostly Dad's stereo I bartered to him).
2. Help Michele with Christmas tree and other projects.
3. Mulch pile.

 **WORK**

1. Decide which courses to take now.
2. Start courses
3. goals of next blog post

Started today fixing an issue on my website - with the prompt from Carl Willis on the WordPress Development StackExchange forum. Nice start after 8 hour sleep.

This am, kids visit then I go watch the Charger game with Bob where he is now. Then home to finish some other website tasks.

I continue gassy for unknown reasons.  The only thing that seems to help is taking Imodium to slow down the hyperactivity of the bowels.  I'm cutting coffee intake, not eating fruit, and increasing probiotics.

Writing a little later this am. Woke many time early in sleep and again this am by Barney then Michele up before me. All of this left me tired and low energy. I usually write first off, set up may plan for the day then eat. 

By the time I'd eaten and drank some coffee, I was more awake.  I started off with a light task from my list for today: studying a post on time management for WordPress solopreneurs. 

A short ride down a rabbit hole that yielded some good suggestions - time blocking -, more good reading to do, and a list of good apps that help with productivity. It was refreshing that it did not go to to do apps but built from a polling of WordPress professionals.

**December 19th 2016. Monday**
<p>This is the week leading up to Christmas on Sunday.  For us the  most stressful trime of the year as Christmas eve is when we have n open house for the families of our family. Usually 25 to 30 of us from all sides and 3 generations.</p>
<p>Last Chargers game of the season is Christmas eve morning.  I've always spent chargers games with Bob.  He's now in a SNF and Zo has told him that since he's on Medi-cal he can't come home.  I think it's important to be with him. At the same time, Michele will be worried about the evenings festivities and setting up for that.  I'll do what I can do to help her be ready by Friday.</p>

<p>Today the holiday season gets pumped up.  Brad arrives. He comes here once a year and stays about a week.  Brad was Chris' best friend from preschool through high school when he moved with his father to Texas. This was after his mother died of cancer.</p>
<p>Once in Texas, Brad's father took his life and Brad then moved to Arkansas to be near his biological family.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, Michele and I realized this home, where he spent most of his childhood, was the only stable thing in his life since his mom's death.</p>

<p>So Brad will be here this afternoon for a week.  He is loud, impulsive and self-centered.  Sometimes he is critical. These characteristics are a result of his ADD.  He is a kind and caring person. Since he doesn't need to work and loves computer games, he lives a bit like a loner. His Add interferes with his establishing new friends. So, Michele and I are like parents. Chris and Steph, friends. </p>
<p>Let the holidays begin.</p>
