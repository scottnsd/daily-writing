# Daily Writings #

This is where I post daily rambling. Currently this is mostly my commitment to write 100 words a day.  I usually do this first thing in the day when I'm hardly awake.

These are not written to any person real or imagined but are private.  If I could afford it I might pay to make this repository private. However, since I'm also learning Git, etc., and experimenting with publishing this it make sense I don't mind if you read it.  Be forewarned it is mostly mundane stuff.  

My hopes are this writing execise will become a habit and will lead to regular andmore frequent, pretinent, and readable blog posts elsewhere.
